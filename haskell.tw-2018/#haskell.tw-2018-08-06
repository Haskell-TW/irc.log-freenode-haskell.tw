16:47:26 <u1dzer03> Christel just posted this "denial" on the freenode blog https://freenode.net/news/spam-shake
16:47:26 <u1dzer03> This blog is essentially an ad for the Handshake ICO scam with a one-line "denial" of involvement mixed in there. It's obviously very unethical of Christel to not mention her own involvement in the scam which the blog post promotes.
